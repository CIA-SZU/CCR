This program mainly implements the CMaOEA-AIR algorithm which was described in our paper:

A Constrained Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Adaptive Infeasible Ratio


**************************************************************************************************************************************

The code was written in matlab and based on the PlatEMO-V2.3. PlatEMO is an open source and 
free MATLAB-based platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. 
Users should dowmnload the PlatEMO at https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO.
Then copy the CMaOEA-AIR folder to the PlatEMO\Algorithms\. And copy the DASCMaOP and DTLZ folder to the PlatEMO\Problems\. Users can run PlatEMO by invoking the main()function.
Then the test module can be seen on the GUI. Users only needs to select the 2REA algorithm, 
MOP and operator from the dorp-dowm list,input the corresonding parameters value in the text boxs.
Press the run button to execute the algorithm.The real-time population will be displayed in the axis.
